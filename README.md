# Clustering_algorithms_applied_to_the_digits_data_set
The repository is a side product of a course in pattern recognition and machine learning given at Goettingen university in spring 2018. It contains a couple of python scripts written for illustrating the concepts of clustering algorithms and machine learning. They are all applied to the digits data set. The performance is in most cases evaluated by success rate.
